## Purpose

This project is meant to be a private booking calendar for my family's cabin. 

### Planned featues:
* Private bookings: if you want the cabin for yourself
* Open bookings: where others can sign up for parts of, or the entirety of the trip. Aimed to make it easier to plan 
family trips.
* Fridge status: ability to upload images to let others know what is left at the cabin.
